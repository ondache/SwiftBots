ERRORS
======
- Message from admin sending functions doesn't log if raised.
- Bots with not overloaded loggers ain't using app's logger

TODOS
=====
- Add picture handling for TelegramBot
- use normal logger. Take a look at alembic as an example (in alembic.ini configuration)
- Remake ways to start/stop bots. Using base exception breaks a grpc server
- Make an integration or an example with celery
- Use pydantic instead dicts in listeners
- Add logs everywhere
- Admin util to get all the user commands
- Create utils to manage tasks
- Remove ILogger and its implementations

REFACTORING
===========
- Write documentation

TODOS TESTS

TODOS EXAMPLES
