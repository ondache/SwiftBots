This example demonstrates how to the `ChatBot` interface to create commands and route them to their respective handlers.  
The example illustrates commands concepts in a simple console application. 
While the console version itself is useless, the `ChatBot` class features a powerful routing system. 
This should be used as a base class for production-ready bots, such as, let's say, **WhatsAppBot** or **TelegramBot** 
(the last is already implemented within this framework).
