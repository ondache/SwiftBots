This example demonstrates how to structure a bot ecosystem using an admin bot.  
The admin bot handles start, stop, and list commands for the other bots.  
All the bots, including the admin bot, are running in a single python script.  

If you need an example of how to run a dedicated admin bot, follow the example in `grpc_admin`.
